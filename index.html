            <p>Orderly, calculated packing allows you to hike with greater ease and retrieve key items when you need them without disrupting all your gear.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Heavy Items: </span>Pack <code class="bold">high</code> and close to your back for normal terrain, but pack along the <code class="bold">center</code> of your back for terrain where your balance is critical.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Light Items: </span>Pack clothing, dried foods, sleeping bag, and other light items at the bottom of the back and/or away from your back.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Handy Items: </span>Keep items you want access to quickly such as sunglasses, repellant, first aid kit, snacks, rain gear, and toilet paper, map, in outside pockets or at the very top.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Long items: </span>Lash to pack frame.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Water Proof: </span>Toilet kit, maps, matches, should be in waterproof compartments.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Organizer Bags: </span>Use separate, color-coded bags to store clothing, food, tent, cooking utensils.</li>
            </ul>

              <p class="p-head">BASIC STRATEGY ></p>
              <p>Concerve heat but release perspiration without soaking clothing by <code class="bold">layering your clothing</code> appropriately.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Layer 1: </span>Next to your skin wear synthetics such as polyester, polypropylene which absorb little moisture.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Layer 2: </span>Cover the first layer with insulating clothing such as pile or fleece, and wear clothing that will keep you warm even if wet such as wool and polypropylene. In extreme cold, wear a light down jacket over the second layer.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Layer 3: </span>The last layer of clothing is the waterproof, windproof layer that allows perspiration to escape (Gore-Tex material is appropriate).</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Head: </span>Wear a hat to cover exposed skin.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Hands: </span>Wear gloves to cover exposed skin.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Wet Weather Gear: </span>Wear a two-piece pants and jacket suit instead of using the classic rain poncho which will catch the wind and drain onto your legs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="highlight">Caution</p>
                <p>Consider wearing several lighter layers instead of carrying a heavy, insulated jacket such as the classic parka.</p>

            <p>Consume <code class="bold">Carbohydrates</code> for <code class="bold">Quick Energy</code> and consume <code class="bold">Proteins</code> and <code class="bold">Fats</code> for <code class="bold">Concentrated Energy</code> which will be released over a longer period of time.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Carbohydrates: </span>Should be at least half of your trail diet, consumed both as main meals and snacks.<br>
                <p class="columnA">Breads<br> Millet<br> Rice</p>
                <p class="columnB"> Chocolate<br> Oatmeal<br> Sugar</p>
                <p class="columnC">Crackers<br> Pastas<br></p>
              </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Proteins and Fats: </span>Should be 10 to 20 percent of your trail diet (except in winter when it should be doubled), consumed before hiking and before going to bed in the evening.<br>
                <p class="columnA">Cheeses<br> Instant Potatoes<br> Nuts</p>
                <p class="columnB">Dried Fruits<br> Jerky<br> Sardines</p>
                <p class="columnC"> Honey<br> Milk<br> Sausage</p>
            </li>
              <li>Store foods in a bag you can hang in a tree; do not store foods in your tent or unattended backpack unless it too is strung up in a tree.</li>
              <li>Eat foods that weigh the most early in your trip.</li>

            <p class="p-head">KEY CONSIDERATIONS ></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The time it takes to cook a meal depends on the altitude at which you are camping. <code class="bold">As you gain altitude and air pressure drops, water boils at a lower temperature but takes longer to boil,</code> and most backpacking foods are boiled.</li>
              <li>At 5,000 ft. cooking time is twice that at sea level. At 10,000 ft., four times that at sea level. At 15,000 ft., seven times; and, at 20,000 ft., thirteen times.</li>
              <li>Cooking time can be reduced by presoaking in cold water such foods as dried meat, dried vegetables, and legumes, and by cooking with covers on each pot.</li>
              <li>Use <code class="bold">windscreens</code> and/or <code class="bold">heat reflectors</code> to make your stoves and your cooking more efficient.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Clean your utensils</span> as soon as you have finished eating to avoid developing bacteria and to avoid attracting animals.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Carry an extra container of fuel</span> as a safety precaution.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="p-head">SELECTION ></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pick a scenic location if possible.</li>
              <li>Pick a flat, smooth area sheltered from wind, 10-15 feet above steam, lake, or meadow.</li>
              <li>Avoid low, wet areas where rain water drains.</li>
              <li>Avoid camping in high, exposed areas.</li>
              <li>Use a clump of trees or bushes, a gully, or a low wall or even a rain fly to deflect the wind.</li>
              <li>Avoid dead trees that might blow down on your tent or on you and your companions.</li>
              <li>Stay back from sources of water to avoid contaminating them.</li>
              <li>Pick a location where you can position your sleeping bag to catch the morning sun.</li>
              <li>Camp where firewood is available.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">In bear country locate your camp as illustrated below: </span></li>
